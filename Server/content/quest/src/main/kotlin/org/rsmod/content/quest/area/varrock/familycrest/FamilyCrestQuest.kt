/**
 * Family Crest.
 *
 * The stage is `varp.crestquest`, endstate 11 from `dbrow.quest_familycrest`. Each of the three
 * sons is a multinpc indexing that varp directly: Avan is an anonymous "Man" until the stage
 * reaches [STAGE_AVAN_FOUND], and all three gain their "Gauntlets" op at [STAGE_COMPLETE].
 *
 * The three errands can be done in any order, so the errands themselves are tracked on
 * `varp.famcrest_state` and the stage is recomputed from them by [syncStage], which only ever
 * moves forward. The stage numbers below are therefore the order the quest is *usually* done in,
 * not an order the player is held to - the only value the cache pins is [STAGE_AVAN_FOUND].
