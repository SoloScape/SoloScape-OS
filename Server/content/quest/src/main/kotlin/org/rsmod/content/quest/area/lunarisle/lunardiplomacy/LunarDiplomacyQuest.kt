/**
 * Lunar Diplomacy.
 *
 * The stage is `varbit.lunar_quest_main` (bits 0-19 of `varp.lunar_quest`), endstate 190 from
 * `dbrow.quest_lunardiplomacy`. The values are the ones the cache's multi-npcs switch on: Lokar
 * offers the Pirates' Cove trip from [STAGE_SAILED_TO_COVE], Captain Bentley gains his Travel
 * option at [STAGE_AT_LUNAR_ISLE], and the cabin boy on the Lady Zay shows only on the ship stages.
 *
 * Everything else lives on the quest's own cache varbits in `varp.lunar_quest1..5`, which the
 * client reads for the ship's symbols, the dice, the log piles and the brazier. Several of those
 * varbits share bits (the Dream World challenges reuse the ship's symbol bits and each other's),
 * so a challenge clears its scratch varbits whenever the player leaves its island.
