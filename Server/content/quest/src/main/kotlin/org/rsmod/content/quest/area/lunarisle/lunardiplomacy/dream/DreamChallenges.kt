/**
 * The six islands of the Dream World. Their state is kept on the quest's cache varbits, several
 * of which overlap (the numbers game's sequence shares bits with the mimic's and the woodcutting
 * game's flags), so [clearScratch] wipes every island's working state whenever the player lands on
 * or leaves an island, and only the progress varbits survive.
 *
 * - Chance: six dice whose opposite faces sum to seven; flipping one swaps it between its two
 *   faces, and the Fluke's number must be made five times.
 * - Numbers: the Numerator reads out one of sixteen sequences; the next two numbers must be pressed.
 * - Mimic: copy five of the Mimic's emotes.
 * - Woodcutting: deposit twenty dream logs before the Perceptive, who adds two every few ticks.
 * - Race: beat the Expert, who walks a straight lane, over the course with four hurdles.
 * - Memory: cross a four-by-eight field of dream puffs; only the puffs on one hidden path hold.
