/**
 * The level-up box in the chatbox - `interface.levelup_display`, the one with the skill's icon,
 * "Congratulations, you just advanced a Cooking level." and "Click here to continue".
 *
 * The interface holds one hidden layer per skill (plus `combat`), each containing that skill's
 * icon models, and shares `text1`, `text2` and `continue` across all of them. There is no
 * clientscript driving it, so showing the right icon is the server's job: open the interface, then
 * un-hide the one layer that matches the skill.
 *
 * The layer names line up with the stat names - `attack`, `cooking`, `woodcutting` - so they are
 * derived rather than tabulated, with [LAYER_ALIASES] covering the one that does not match and a
 * check against the interface itself so a skill with no layer falls back to plain chat lines
 * instead of throwing.
 *
 * #### Why it is not a modal
 *
 * The box must not interrupt the player: in Old School RuneScape you keep fighting, fishing or
 * walking with it open. A server-side modal makes the player busy, and a busy player's interaction
 * is skipped but still re-routed every cycle - a ranger or mage who levelled mid-fight walked up to
 * their target while the box was open. So it goes through `ifOpenChatOverlay`: the client treats it
 * as a modal (a world click dismisses it, `continue` works as an [IfEvent.PauseButton]) while the
 * server tracks it as an overlay and carries on underneath. Anything that opens its own chat modal
 * replaces it, which is also how Old School RuneScape behaves.
 *
 * #### Why it never lands on top of a dialogue
 *
 * Opening a chat modal closes whatever is in that slot, which would strand a suspended dialogue.
 * It cannot happen here: `PlayerEngineQueueProcessor` only publishes an engine queue while the
 * player is not access-protected, and a player waiting on a dialogue is.
