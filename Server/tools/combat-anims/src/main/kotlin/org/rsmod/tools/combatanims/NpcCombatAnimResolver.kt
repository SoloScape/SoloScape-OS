/**
 * Decides which combat animations an npc should play, from what it is and what it holds.
 *
 * Two kinds of npc are handled:
 * - **Humanoids** share the player skeleton, so they use the player animations of the weapon
 *   they hold: the weapon's own `attack_anim_stance1`, `defend_anim`, sound and projectile. A
 *   shield overrides the block animation, as it does for players. Casters - staff or bare-handed
 *   npcs whose magic level leads, or whose name says wizard, druid, necromancer and so on - cast
 *   a strike spell instead of hitting with the staff. A humanoid whose weapon is not an item at
 *   all (the barbarians' giant axes, great hammers and two-handed swords, the ice warriors'
 *   swords) is recognised by its ready stance instead - see [stanceWeapons] - so it swings
 *   rather than punches.
 * - **Monsters** get their animation family from the name of their ready animation, via
 *   [AnimationFamilies].
 *
 * The resolver is pure: it takes facts and returns names, so it is unit tested without a cache.
